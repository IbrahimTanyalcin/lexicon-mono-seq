abstract={High-accuracy alignment of sequences with disease information contributes to disease treatment and prevention. The results of multiple sequence alignment depend on the parameters of the objective function, including gap open penalties (GOP), gap extension penalties (GEP), and substitution matrix (SM). Firstly, the theory parameter formulas relating to GOP, GAP, and SM are inferred, combining unaligned sequence length, number, and identity. Secondly, we tested the rationality of the theory parameter formulas, with experiment on the ClustalW and MAFFT program. In addition, we obtained a group of MAFFT program parameters according to the formulas proposed. The results of all experiments show that the SPS (sum-of-pair score) obtained from theory parameters is better than the SPS obtained from the default parameters of ClustalW and MAFFT. In both theory and practice, our method to determine the parameters is feasible and efficient. These can provide high-accuracy alignment results for precision medicine.},

title={SnipViz: a compact and lightweight web site widget for display and dissemination of multiple versions of gene and protein sequences},
journal={BMC Res Notes},

publisher={BioMed Central},
volume={7},
pages={468-468},
abstract={BACKGROUND: As high throughput sequencing continues to grow more commonplace, the need to disseminate the resulting data via web applications continues to grow. Particularly, there is a need to disseminate multiple versions of related gene and protein sequences simultaneously--whether they represent alleles present in a single species, variations of the same gene among different strains, or homologs among separate species. Often this is accomplished by displaying all versions of the sequence at once in a manner that is not intuitive or space-efficient and does not facilitate human understanding of the data. Web-based applications needing to disseminate multiple versions of sequences would benefit from a drop-in module designed to effectively disseminate these data. FINDINGS: SnipViz is a client-side software tool designed to disseminate multiple versions of related gene and protein sequences on web sites. SnipViz has a space-efficient, interactive, and dynamic interface for navigating, analyzing and visualizing sequence data. It is written using standard World Wide Web technologies (HTML, Javascript, and CSS) and is compatible with most web browsers. SnipViz is designed as a modular client-side web component and may be incorporated into virtually any web site and be implemented without any programming. CONCLUSIONS: SnipViz is a drop-in client-side module for web sites designed to efficiently visualize and disseminate gene and protein sequences. SnipViz is open source and is freely available at https://github.com/yeastrc/snipviz.},

To circumvent these limitations, ASCIIGenome runs exclusively via command line interface to display genomic data directly in a terminal window. By following the same philosophy of UNIX tools, ASCIIGenome aims to be easily integrated with the command line, including batch processing of data, and therefore enables an effective exploration of the data.ASCIIGenome is written in Java. Consequently, it is a cross-platform tool and requires minimal or no installation. Some of the common genomic data types are supported and data access on remote ftp servers is possible. Speed and memory footprint are comparable to or better than those of common genome browsers.Software and source code (MIT License) are available at https://github.com/dariober/ASCIIGenome with detailed documentation at http://asciigenome.readthedocs.io.Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.}",
